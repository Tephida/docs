# Getting Started

## Technical Requirements

Before creating your first Tephida application you must:

- Install PHP 8.0.2 or higher and these PHP extensions (which are installed and enabled by default in most PHP 8 installations)
- Install Composer, which is used to install PHP packages.

## Installing Tephida

You can also install Jekyll with brew.

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist tephida/tephida my_project_directory
cd my_project_directory
composer install
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://site.com/install.php.
